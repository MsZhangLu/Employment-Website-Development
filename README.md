# Naive-Employment-Website
This is my naive design and development of an employment website in Chinese. 

In this program, I designed and implemented an employment website with a content management system. 

The back-end systems was developed with Spring Framework, MVC pattern, and MyBatis persistence framework. The front-end system was realised by adopting Bootstrap Framework.
